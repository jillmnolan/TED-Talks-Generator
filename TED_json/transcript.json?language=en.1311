I started thinking\nabout somebody grabbing a lever,"},{"time":181545,"text":"and if they grab\nnear the end of the lever,"},{"time":183658,"text":"they can get an effectively long

rough terrain."},{"time":225133,"text":"Again, the key innovation of this technology\nis that when he wants to go fast,"},{"time":229664,"text":"he just grabs the levers near the pivots\nand goes through a big angle every stroke,"},{"time":233719,"text":"and as the going gets tougher, he just\nslides his hands up the levers,"},{"time":236644,"text":"creates more torque, and kind\nof

complex\nmachine in this system."},{"time":247151,"text":"It's the person that's sliding\nhis hands up and down the levers,"},{"time":250497,"text":"so the mechanism itself can be very simple"},{"time":253219,"text":"and composed of bicycle parts you\ncan get anywhere in the world."},{"time":256291,"text":"Because those bicycle parts"},{"time":257882,"text":"are so ubiquitously

has local tools, knowledge\nand parts available."},{"time":273970,"text":"Now, when you want to use the LFC indoors,"},{"time":276647,"text":"all you have to do is pull\nthe levers out of the

enough to fit under a table,"},{"time":295759,"text":"and it's small and maneuverable\nenough to fit in a bathroom"},{"time":299752,"text":"and this is important so the user\ncan get up close to a

want to stress"},{"time":313163,"text":"that I think really hit\nhome in this project."},{"time":316795,"text":"The first is that this\nproduct works well because"},{"time":319999,"text":"we were

factors"},{"time":329961,"text":"important to wheelchair users\nin the developing countries."},{"time":332498,"text":"So I'm an academic at MIT,\nand I'm a mechanical engineer,"},{"time":334986,"text":"so I can do things like look at the type\nof terrain you want to travel on,"},{"time":338534,"text":"and figure out how much\nresistance it should impose,"},{"time":341182,"text":"look at the parts we have\navailable and mix and match them"},{"time":344190,"text":"to figure out what sort\nof gear trains we can use,"},{"time":346835,"text":"and then look at the power and force\nyou can get out of your upper body"},{"time":349944,"text":"to analyze how fast you should\nbe able to go in this chair"},{"time":351907,"text":"as you put your arms\nup and down the levers."},{"time":354278,"text":"So as a wet-behind-the-ears\nstudent, excited,"},{"time":357937,"text":"our team made a prototype,"},{"time":360062,"text":"brought that prototype to Tanzania,\nKenya and Vietnam in 2008,"},{"time":364937,"text":"and found it was terrible"},{"time":367071,"text":"because we didn't get\nenough input from users."},{"time":369508,"text":"So because we tested it\nwith wheelchair users,"},{"time":372674,"text":"with wheelchair manufacturers,\nwe got that feedback from them,"},{"time":375180,"text":"not just articulating their problems,\nbut articulating their solutions,"},{"time":378634,"text":"and worked together to go back\nto the drawing board and make a new design,"},{"time":382182,"text":"which we brought back\nto East Africa in '09"},{"time":384332,"text":"that worked a lot better than a normal\nwheelchair on rough terrain,"},{"time":387177,"text":"but it still didn't work well\nindoors because it was too big,"},{"time":390059,"text":"it was heavy, it was hard to move around,"},{"time":392057,"text":"so again with that user feedback,\nwe went back to the drawing board,"},{"time":395611,"text":"came up with a better\ndesign, 20 pounds lighter,"},{"time":397926,"text":"as narrow as a regular wheelchair, tested\nthat in a field trial in Guatemala,"},{"time":401617,"text":"and that advanced the product to the point"},{"time":403641,"text":"where we have now that it's going\ninto production."},{"time":406864,"text":"Now also being engineering scientists,"},{"time":409110,"text":"we were able to quantify the performance\nbenefits of the Leveraged Freedom Chair,"},{"time":412992,"text":"so here are some shots\nof our trial in Guatemala"},{"time":415632,"text":"where we tested the LFC\non village terrain,"},{"time":419174,"text":"and tested people's biomechanical outputs,"},{"time":421198,"text":"their oxygen consumption,\nhow fast they go,"},{"time":423385,"text":"how much power they're putting out,"},{"time":425076,"text":"both in their regular\nwheelchairs and using the LFC,"},{"time":427975,"text":"and we found that the LFC\nis about 80 percent faster"},{"time":430476,"text":"going on these terrains\nthan a normal wheelchair."},{"time":432834,"text":"It's also about 40 percent more\nefficient than a regular wheelchair,"},{"time":436217,"text":"and because of the mechanical\nadvantage you get from the levers,"},{"time":438760,"text":"you can produce 50 percent higher torque"},{"time":440689,"text":"and really muscle your way\nthrough the really, really rough terrain."},{"time":444673,"text":"Now the second lesson\nthat we learned in this is that"},{"time":448109,"text":"the constraints on this design\nreally push the innovation,"},{"time":451009,"text":"because we had to hit\nsuch a low price point,"},{"time":453273,"text":"because we had to make\na device that could travel"},{"time":455583,"text":"on many, many types of terrain\nbut still be usable indoors,"},{"time":458402,"text":"and be simple enough to repair,"},{"time":460693,"text":"we ended up with a fundamentally\nnew product,"},{"time":463060,"text":"a new product that is an innovation"},{"time":465176,"text":"in a space that really hasn't\nchanged in a hundred years."},{"time":468093,"text":"And these are all merits that are not\njust good in the developing world."},{"time":471546,"text":"Why not in countries like the U.S. too?"},{"time":473985,"text":"So we teamed up with Continuum,"},{"time":475721,"text":"a local product design firm here in Boston"},{"time":477745,"text":"to make the high-end version,\nthe developed world version,"},{"time":480753,"text":"that we'll probably sell primarily\nin the U.S. and Europe,"},{"time":483539,"text":"but to higher-income buyers."},{"time":486340,"text":"And the final point I want\nto make is that I think"},{"time":489326,"text":"this project worked\nwell because we engaged"},{"time":492152,"text":"all the stakeholders that buy into this\nproject and are important to consider"},{"time":496763,"text":"in bringing the technology\nfrom inception of an idea"},{"time":500106,"text":"through innovation, validation,\ncommercialization and dissemination,"},{"time":504345,"text":"and that cycle has to start\nand end with end users."},{"time":508090,"text":"These are the people that define\nthe requirements of the technology,"},{"time":510865,"text":"and these are the people that have\nto give the thumbs-up at the end,"},{"time":513203,"text":"and say, \"Yeah, it actually works.\nIt meets our needs.\""},{"time":515847,"text":"So people like me in the academic space,"},{"time":517777,"text":"we can do things like innovate\nand analyze and test,"},{"time":521148,"text":"create data and make\nbench-level prototypes,"},{"time":524244,"text":"but how do you get that bench-level\nprototype to commercialization?"},{"time":527411,"text":"So we need gap-fillers like Continuum\nthat can work on commercializing,"},{"time":530823,"text":"and we started a whole NGO\nto bring our chair to market --"},{"time":533609,"text":"Global Research Innovation Technology --"},{"time":535774,"text":"and then we also teamed up with a big\nmanufacturer in India, Pinnacle Industries,"},{"time":539506,"text":"that's tooled up now\nto make 500 chairs a month"},{"time":541769,"text":"and will make the first\nbatch of 200 next month,"},{"time":543572,"text":"which will be delivered in India."},{"time":545540,"text":"And then finally, to get this\nout to the people in scale,"},{"time":548279,"text":"we teamed up with the largest\ndisability organization"},{"time":550827,"text":"in the world, Jaipur Foot."},{"time":553114,"text":"Now what's powerful about this model"},{"time":555393,"text":"is when you bring together\nall these stakeholders"},{"time":558200,"text":"that represent each link in the chain"},{"time":560169,"text":"from inception of an idea"},{"time":562710,"text":"all the way to implementation\nin the field,"},{"time":565478,"text":"that's where the magic happens."},{"time":567029,"text":"That's where you can take\na guy like me, an academic,"},{"time":569577,"text":"but analyze and test\nand create a new technology"},{"time":572605,"text":"and quantitatively determine\nhow much better the performance is."},{"time":576141,"text":"You can connect with stakeholders\nlike the manufacturers"},{"time":578802,"text":"and talk with them face-to-face\nand leverage their"},{"time":581062,"text":"local knowledge of manufacturing\npractices and their clients"},{"time":583933,"text":"and combine that knowledge\nwith our engineering knowledge"},{"time":586672,"text":"to create something greater\nthan either of us could have done alone."},{"time":590002,"text":"And then you can also engage the end user"},{"time":592533,"text":"in the design process, and not\njust ask him what he needs,"},{"time":595319,"text":"but ask him how he thinks\nit can be achieved."},{"time":598268,"text":"And this picture was taken\nin India in our last field trial,"},{"time":601325,"text":"where we
