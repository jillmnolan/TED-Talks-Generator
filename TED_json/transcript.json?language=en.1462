continue to work\nand we can continue to produce in the U.S."},{"time":430795,"text":"And so our vision is that Mildred\nwho's the line worker"},{"time":434860,"text":"becomes Mildred the robot trainer."},{"time":437777,"text":"She lifts her game,"},{"time":438922,"text":"like the office workers of the 1980s\nlifted their game of what they could do."},{"time":443509,"text":"We're not giving

demographics."},{"time":458203,"text":"Demographics is really\ngoing to change our world."},{"time":460870,"text":"This is the percentage\nof adults who are working age."},{"time":464832,"text":"And it's gone down slightly\nover the last 40 years."},{"time":467285,"text":"But over the next 40 years, it's going\nto change dramatically, even in China."},{"time":471165,"text":"The percentage of adults who are working\nage drops dramatically."},{"time":476002,"text":"And turned up the other way, the people\nwho are retirement age goes up very, very fast,"},{"time":481092,"text":"as the baby

services."},{"time":491610,"text":"But more than that, as we get\nolder we get more frail"},{"time":495661,"text":"and we can't do all the tasks\nwe used to do."},{"time":497910,"text":"If we look at
