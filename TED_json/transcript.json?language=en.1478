live and work."},{"time":150026,"text":"Obviously, one of the most important\nthings was the sheep,"},{"time":152812,"text":"and so my job was, well,\npretty much to do everything,"},{"time":155749,"text":"but it was about bringing\nthe sheep back to the homestead."},{"time":159149,"text":"And we'd do that by building fences,"},{"time":161140,"text":"using motorbikes

learned was,"},{"time":171862,"text":"although at the time, like everyone else,"},{"time":173958,"text":"I thought sheep were pretty stupid"},{"time":175602,"text":"because they didn't do\nwhat we wanted them to do,"},{"time":177310,"text":"what I realize now, probably\nonly just in the last few weeks"},{"time":180431,"text":"looking back, is the sheep\nweren't stupid at all."},{"time":182462,"text":"We'd put them in an environment\nwhere they didn't want to be,"},{"time":184894,"text":"and they didn't want to do\nwhat we wanted them to do."},{"time":187442,"text":"So the challenge was to try and get them"},{"time":189856,"text":"to do what we wanted them to do"},{"time":190878,"text":"by listening to the weather,\nthe lay of the land,"},{"time":193969,"text":"and

realize now that it\nwas pretty much the same"},{"time":220350,"text":"as moving sheep around."},{"time":222187,"text":"It really is."},{"time":224461,"text":"It's just you do it\nby changing an environment."},{"time":227317,"text":"And that's kind\nof been a big lesson to me,"},{"time":229368,"text":"that you can't act on any object."},{"time":230964,"text":"You change its environment,\nand the object will flow."},{"time":233512,"text":"So we made it very small,"},{"time":235554,"text":"so things were about 30\nnanometers in size;"},{"time":238442,"text":"making it very cold, so\nat

on"},{"time":256517,"text":"and one electron off."},{"time":258452,"text":"And I was told that I wouldn't\nbe able to do this,"},{"time":261314,"text":"which, you know, as we've heard\nfrom other people,"},{"time":263328,"text":"that's the thing that makes you do it."},{"time":265162,"text":"And I was determined, and I managed\nto show that I could do that."},{"time":268700,"text":"And a lot of that learning, I think,"},{"time":270439,"text":"came from being on that farm,"},{"time":271944,"text":"because when I was working on the farm,"},{"time":273969,"text":"we'd have to use what was around us,"},{"time":275997,"text":"we'd have to use the environment,"},{"time":277790,"text":"and there was no such thing"},{"time":279664,"text":"as something can't be

know,"},{"time":286679,"text":"I had seen that sort of thing happen."},{"time":290409,"text":"So now my obsession is printing,"},{"time":293019,"text":"and I'm really fascinated by the idea"},{"time":295836,"text":"of using conventional printing processes,"},{"time":298780,"text":"so the types of print\nthat are used to create"},{"time":301005,"text":"many of the things around us"},{"time":302363,"text":"to make paper and card interactive."},{"time":306128,"text":"When I spoke to some printers\nwhen I started doing this"},{"time":308249,"text":"and told them what I wanted to do,"},{"time":309893,"text":"which was to print\nconductive inks onto paper,"},{"time":312119,"text":"they told me it couldn't be done,"},{"time":313715,"text":"again, that kind of favorite thing."},{"time":315961,"text":"So I got about 10 credit cards and loans"},{"time":320667,"text":"and got myself very close\nto bankruptcy, really,"},{"time":324165,"text":"and bought myself this\nhuge printing press,"},{"time":326258,"text":"which I had no idea how to use at all."},{"time":328382,"text":"It was about five meters long,"},{"time":329913,"text":"and I covered myself\nand the floor with ink"},{"time":332171,"text":"and made a massive mess,\nbut I learned to print."},{"time":335459,"text":"And then I took it back to the printers\nand showed them what I've done,"},{"time":337988,"text":"and they were like, \"Of\ncourse you can do that."},{"time":340203,"text":"Why didn't you come here\nin the first place?\""},{"time":342407,"text":"That's always the case."},{"time":345377,"text":"So what we do is we take\nconventional printing presses,"},{"time":349164,"text":"we make conductive inks,"},{"time":351119,"text":"and run those through a press,\nand basically"},{"time":354612,"text":"just letting hundreds\nof thousands of electrons flow"},{"time":357964,"text":"through pieces of paper"},{"time":359335,"text":"so we can make that paper interactive."},{"time":361324,"text":"And it's pretty simple, really."},{"time":362825,"text":"It's just a collection of things\nthat have been done before,"},{"time":365688,"text":"but bringing them together\nin a different way."},{"time":367903,"text":"So we have a piece of paper\nwith conductive ink on,"},{"time":370527,"text":"and then add onto that a small circuit\nboard with a couple of chips,"},{"time":375140,"text":"one to run some capacitive touch software,"},{"time":377206,"text":"so we know where we've touched it,"},{"time":378850,"text":"and the other to run, quite often,"},{"time":381388,"text":"some wireless software so\nthe piece of paper can connect."},{"time":385351,"text":"So I'll just describe a couple\nof things that we've created."},{"time":388758,"text":"There's lots of different\nthings we've created."},{"time":391021,"text":"This is one of them, because I love cake."},{"time":393462,"text":"And this one, it's a large poster,"},{"time":396154,"text":"and you touch it and it has\na little speaker behind it,"},{"time":398392,"text":"and the poster talks\nto you when you touch it"},{"time":400630,"text":"and asks you a series of questions,"},{"time":402321,"text":"and it works out your perfect cake."},{"time":404335,"text":"But it doesn't tell you\nthe cake there and then."},{"time":406731,"text":"It uploads a picture,"},{"time":408329,"text":"and the reason why it\nchose that cake for you,"},{"time":410727,"text":"to our Facebook page and to Twitter."},{"time":413950,"text":"So we're trying to create that connection"},{"time":416777,"text":"between the physical and the digital,"},{"time":418563,"text":"but have it not looking on a screen,"},{"time":420601,"text":"and just looking like a regular poster."},{"time":423724,"text":"We've worked with a bunch\nof universities on a project"},{"time":428460,"text":"looking at interactive newsprint."},{"time":430437,"text":"So for example, we've created a newspaper,"},{"time":432578,"text":"a regular newspaper."},{"time":433893,"text":"You can wear a pair of headphones\nthat are connected to it wirelessly,"},{"time":436878,"text":"and when you touch it,\nyou can hear the music"},{"time":439045,"text":"that's described on the top,\nwhich is something you can't read."},{"time":442069,"text":"You can hear a press conference"},{"time":444235,"text":"as well as reading\nwhat the editor has determined"},{"time":446779,"text":"that press conference was about."},{"time":448327,"text":"And you can press a Facebook \"like\" button"},{"time":450464,"text":"or you can vote on something as well."},{"time":453143,"text":"Something else that we created,"},{"time":454382,"text":"and this was an idea that I had\na couple of years ago,"},{"time":456646,"text":"and so we've done a project on this."},{"time":457715,"text":"It was for funding from the government"},{"time":459756,"text":"for user-centered design\nfor energy-efficient buildings,"},{"time":463286,"text":"difficult to say, and something\nI had no idea what it was"},{"time":465320,"text":"when I went into the workshop,\nbut quickly learned."},{"time":468104,"text":"And we wanted to try and encourage people"},{"time":470267,"text":"to use energy better."},{"time":472115,"text":"And I really liked the idea that,\ninstead of looking at dials"},{"time":475637,"text":"and reading things to say --"},{"time":478183,"text":"looking at your energy usage,"},{"time":480125,"text":"I wanted to create a poster\nthat was wirelessly connected"},{"time":483379,"text":"and had color-changing inks on it,"},{"time":485023,"text":"and so if your energy usage\nwas trending better,"},{"time":488599,"text":"than the leaves would appear\nand the rabbits would appear"},{"time":490926,"text":"and all would be good."},{"time":492312,"text":"And if it wasn't, then there'd be graffiti"},{"time":494336,"text":"and the leaves would fall off the trees."},{"time":496265,"text":"So it was trying to make\nyou look after something"},{"time":498755,"text":"in your immediate environment,"},{"time":500880,"text":"which you don't want to see\nnot looking so good,"},{"time":503369,"text":"rather than expecting people to do things"},{"time":505496,"text":"in the local environment\nbecause of the effect"},{"time":507807,"text":"that it has a long way off."},{"time":509286,"text":"And I think, kind of like going\nback to the farm,"},{"time":511644,"text":"it's about how to let people\ndo what you want them to do"},{"time":514672,"text":"rather than making people do\nwhat you want them to do."},{"time":519089,"text":"Okay."},{"time":520549,"text":"So this is the bit I'm really scared of."},{"time":523371,"text":"So a couple of things I've created are,"},{"time":525610,"text":"there's a poster over here"},{"time":527027,"text":"that you can play drums
