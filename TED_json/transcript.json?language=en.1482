on,"},{"time":187675,"text":"because structure is one of the key\nissues in aircraft design."},{"time":191821,"text":"So let's compare the old\nworld with the new world."},{"time":195093,"text":"I just want to show you here\nwhat we are doing today."},{"time":197641,"text":"So this is a bracket of an A380\ncrew rest compartment."},{"time":201340,"text":"It takes a lot of

kilos."},{"time":219172,"text":"So this technology, 3D\nprinting, and new design rules"},{"time":222439,"text":"really help us to reduce the weight,"},{"time":224178,"text":"which is the biggest issue\nin aircraft design,"},{"time":226626,"text":"because it's directly linked\nto greenhouse gas emissions."},{"time":229365,"text":"Push this idea a little bit forward."},{"time":231185,"text":"So how does nature build its\ncomponents and structures?"},{"time":236076,"text":"So nature is very clever.\nIt puts all the information"},{"time":239117,"text":"into these small building\nblocks, which we call DNA."},{"time":242314,"text":"And nature builds large\nskeletons out of it."},{"time":244890,"text":"So we see a bottom-up approach here,"},{"time":247384,"text":"because all the information,\nas I said, are inside the DNA."},{"time":250549,"text":"And this is combined\nwith a top-down approach,"},{"time":252764,"text":"because what we are doing\nin our daily life"},{"time":254861,"text":"is we train our muscles,\nwe train our skeleton,"},{"time":257966,"text":"and it's getting stronger."},{"time":259966,"text":"And the same approach can be\napplied to technology as well."},{"time":262801,"text":"So our building block is carbon\nnanotubes, for example,"},{"time":266187,"text":"to create a large, rivet-less\nskeleton at the end of the day."},{"time":270453,"text":"How this looks in particular,\nyou can show it here."},{"time":273507,"text":"So imagine you have\ncarbon nanotubes growing"},{"time":275641,"text":"inside a 3D

got trillions of them."},{"time":285113,"text":"So you really align them to wood,"},{"time":287306,"text":"and you take this wood and make\nmorphological optimization,"},{"time":290475,"text":"so you make structures, sub-structures,"},{"time":292434,"text":"which allows you to transmit\nelectrical energy or data."},{"time":296467,"text":"And now we take this\nmaterial, combine this"},{"time":298539,"text":"with a top-down approach,"},{"time":299982,"text":"and build bigger and bigger components."},{"time":303534,"text":"So how might the airplane\nof the future look?"},{"time":306579,"text":"So we have very different\nseats which adapt"},{"time":308700,"text":"to the shape of the future passenger,"},{"time":310486,"text":"with the different anthropometrics."},{"time":312197,"text":"We have social areas inside the aircraft"},{"time":314743,"text":"which might turn into a place"},{"time":317503,"text":"where you can play virtual

radically"},{"time":328191,"text":"how we look at aircrafts in the future."},{"time":330584,"text":"So as Jason Silva said,"},{"time":332608,"text":"if we can imagine it, why not make it so?"},{"time":335131,"text":"See you in the future.
