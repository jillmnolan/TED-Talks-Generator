intense biting rate areas, like Nigeria,"},{"time":862000,"text":"you're certainly not going to eradicate."},{"time":864000,"text":"But that's when you should be favoring evolution towards mildness."},{"time":868000,"text":"So to me, it's an experiment that's waiting to happen,"},{"time":871000,"text":"and if it confirms the prediction, then"},{"time":873000,"text":"we should have a very powerful tool."},{"time":875000,"text":"In a way, much more powerful than the kind of tools we're looking at,"},{"time":878000,"text":"because most of what's being done today is"},{"time":880000,"text":"to rely on things like anti-malarial drugs."},{"time":882000,"text":"And we know that, although it's great to make those"},{"time":885000,"text":"anti-malarial drugs

get evolution"},{"time":901000,"text":"working in the direction we want it to go,"},{"time":903000,"text":"rather than always having to battle evolution as a problem"},{"time":906000,"text":"that

emphasize"},{"time":914000,"text":"that I've only talked about two examples."},{"time":917000,"text":"But as I said earlier, this kind of logic applies across the board"},{"time":920000,"text":"for

living systems;"},{"time":928000,"text":"we're dealing with systems that evolve."},{"time":930000,"text":"And so if you do something with those systems,"},{"time":932000,"text":"they're going to evolve one way or another."},{"time":934000,"text":"And all I'm saying is that we need to figure out how they'll evolve,"},{"time":937000,"text":"so that -- we need to adjust our

go."}]},{"cues":[{"time":945000,"text":"So, I don't really have time to talk about those things,"},{"time":947000,"text":"but I did want to put them up there,"},{"time":949000,"text":"just to give you

with."},{"time":961000,"text":"And this links up with a lot of the other ideas that have been talked about."},{"time":965000,"text":"So, for example, earlier today there was discussion

work."},{"time":979000,"text":"Will it maybe get lowered if we alter the economy of the area?"},{"time":982000,"text":"It may get lowered if we intervene in ways that"},{"time":984000,"text":"encourage people to stay more faithful to partners, and so on."}]},{"cues":[{"time":988000,"text":"But the key thing is to figure out how to lower it,"},{"time":990000,"text":"because if we lower it, we'll get an evolutionary change in the virus."},{"time":993000,"text":"And the data really do support this:"},{"time":995000,"text":"that you actually do get the virus evolving towards mildness."},{"time":998000,"text":"And that will just add to the effectiveness of our control efforts."},{"time":1003000,"text":"So the other thing I really

the kinds of interventions that you want,"},{"time":1014000,"text":"that it indicates should be done,"},{"time":1016000,"text":"are the kinds of interventions that people want anyhow."},{"time":1018000,"text":"But people just haven't been able to justify the cost."}]},{"cues":[{"time":1021000,"text":"So, this is the kind of thing I'm talking about."},{"time":1024000,"text":"If we know that we're going to get extra bang for the buck from providing clean water,"},{"time":1027000,"text":"then I think that we can say,"},{"time":1029000,"text":"let's push the effort into that aspect of the control,"},{"time":1033000,"text":"so that we can actually solve the problem,"},{"time":1036000,"text":"even though, if you just look at the frequency of infection,"},{"time":1039000,"text":"you would suggest that you can't solve the problem well enough"},{"time":1043000,"text":"just by cleaning up water
