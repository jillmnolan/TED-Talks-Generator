this liquid Kevlar, to this natural Kevlar."}]},{"cues":[{"time":111000,"text":"So the insight"},{"time":113000,"text":"is how do you actually reverse engineer this"},{"time":116000,"text":"and go

decades ago,"},{"time":125000,"text":"from a person that I'm very fortunate to work with,"},{"time":129000,"text":"David Kaplan."},{"time":132000,"text":"And so we get this starting

interface it"},{"time":169000,"text":"with some of the things that are typical of technology,"},{"time":171000,"text":"like microelectronics and nanoscale technology."},{"time":174000,"text":"And the image of the DVD here"},{"time":176000,"text":"is just to illustrate a point"},{"time":178000,"text":"that silk follows very subtle topographies of the surface,"},{"time":182000,"text":"which means

there,"},{"time":211000,"text":"and then ..."},{"time":218000,"text":"(Applause)"},{"time":225000,"text":"And the most remarkable feat"},{"time":227000,"text":"is that my hand actually stayed still

biocompatible."},{"time":347000,"text":"And you see here a picture of a tissue section."},{"time":350000,"text":"And so what does that mean, that it's biodegradable and biocompatible?"},{"time":353000,"text":"You can implant it in the body without needing to retrieve what is implanted."},{"time":356000,"text":"Which means that all the devices that you've seen before

you see that reflector tape."},{"time":368000,"text":"So, much like you're seen at night by a car,"},{"time":371000,"text":"then the idea is that you can see, if you illuminate tissue,"},{"time":374000,"text":"you can see deeper parts of tissue"},{"time":376000,"text":"because there is that reflective tape there that is made out of silk."},{"time":378000,"text":"And you see there, it gets reintegrated in tissue."},{"time":380000,"text":"And reintegration in the human body"},{"time":382000,"text":"is not the only thing,"},{"time":384000,"text":"but reintegration in the
