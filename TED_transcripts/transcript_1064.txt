What I'm going to do is,
I'm going to explain to you an extreme green concept that was developed
at NASA's Glenn Research Center in Cleveland, Ohio. But before I do that, we have to go over the definition of what green is, 'cause a lot of us have a
different definition of it. Green. The product is created through environmentally and socially
conscious means. There's plenty of things that
are being called green now. What does it actually mean? We use three metrics to determine green. The first metric is: Is it sustainable? Which means, are you preserving
what you are doing for future use or for future generations? Is it alternative? Is it different
than what is being used today, or does it have a lower carbon footprint than what's used conventionally? And three: Is it renewable? Does it come from Earth's
natural replenishing resources, such as sun, wind and water? Now, my task at NASA is to develop the next generation of aviation fuels. Extreme green. Why aviation? The field of aviation uses
more fuel than just about every other combined. We
need to find an alternative. Also it's a national
aeronautics directive. One of the national aeronautics
goals is to develop the next generation of fuels, biofuels, using domestic and safe,
friendly resources. Now, combating that challenge
