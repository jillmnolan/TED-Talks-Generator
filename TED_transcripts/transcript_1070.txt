I want to talk to you about, or share with you, a
breakthrough new approach for managing items of
inventory inside of a warehouse. We're talking about a pick,
pack and ship setting here. So as a hint, this solution involves
hundreds of mobile robots, sometimes thousands
of mobile robots, moving around a warehouse.
And I'll get to the solution. But for a moment, just think about the last time that
you ordered something online. You were sitting
on your couch and you decided that you
absolutely had to have this red t-shirt.
