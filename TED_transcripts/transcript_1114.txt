I'm going to tell you a little bit
about my TEDxHouston Talk. I woke up the morning
after I gave that talk with the worst vulnerability
hangover of my life. And I actually didn't leave my house
for about three days. The first time I left
was to meet a friend for lunch. And when I walked in,
she was already at the table. I sat down, and she said,
"God, you look like hell." I said, "Thanks. I feel really -- I'm not functioning." And she said, "What's going on?" And I said, "I just told 500 people that I became a researcher

this thing on YouTube. And we're going to be talking
about 600, 700 people." (Laughter) And she said,
"Well, I think it's too late." And I said, "Let me ask you something." And she said, "Yeah." I said, "Do you remember
when we were in college, really wild and kind of dumb?" She said, "Yeah." I said, "Remember when
we'd leave a really bad message on our ex-boyfriend's answering machine? Then we'd have to break into his dorm room
and then erase the tape?" (Laughter) And she goes, "Uh... no." (Laughter) Of course, the only thing
I could say at that point was, "Yeah, me neither. Yeah -- me neither." And I'm thinking to myself,
