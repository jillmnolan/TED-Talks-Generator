So I want to start by offering you
a free no-tech life hack, and all it requires of you is this: that you change your posture
for two minutes. But before I give it away,
I want to ask you to right now do a little audit of your body
and what you're doing with your body. So how many of you are
sort of making yourselves smaller? Maybe you're hunching, crossing your legs,
maybe wrapping your ankles. Sometimes we hold onto our arms like this. Sometimes we spread out. (Laughter) I see you. So I want you to pay attention
to what you're doing right now. We're going to come back
to that in a few minutes, and I'm hoping that if you learn
to tweak this a little bit, it could significantly change
the way your life unfolds. So, we're really fascinated
with body language, and we're particularly interested
in other people's body language.
