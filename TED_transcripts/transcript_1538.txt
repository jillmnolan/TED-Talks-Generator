I'm going to start
by asking you a question: Is anyone familiar
with the blue algae problem? Okay, so most of you are. I think we can all agree
it's a serious issue. Nobody wants to drink
blue algae-contaminated water, or swim in a blue algae-infested lake. Right? I hope you won't be disappointed, but today,
I won't be talking about blue algae. Instead,
I'll be talking about the main cause at the root of this issue, which I will be referring to as
the phosphorus crisis. Why have I chosen to talk to you
about the phosphorus crisis today? For the simple reason
that nobody else is talking about it. And by the end of my presentation,
I hope that the general public will be more aware of this crisis
and this issue. Now, the problem is that if I ask, why do we find ourselves
in this situation with blue algae? The answer is
that it comes from how we farm. We use fertilizers in our farming,
chemical fertilizers. Why do we use chemical fertilizers
in agriculture? Basically, to help plants grow
and to produce a better yield. The issue is that this is set to engender an environmental problem
that is without precedent. Before going further, let me give you
a crash course in plant biology. So, what does a plant need
in order to grow? A plant, quite simply,
needs light, it needs CO2, but even more importantly,
it needs nutrients, which it draws from the soil. Several of these nutrients
are essential chemical elements: phosphorus, nitrogen and calcium.
