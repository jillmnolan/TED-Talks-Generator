the rate of return of capital to exceed the economy's growth rate, and this tends to lead to 
high concentration of wealth. Not infinite concentration of wealth, but the higher the gap between r and g, the higher the level of inequality of wealth towards which society tends to converge. So this is a key force that
I'm going to talk about today, but let me say right away that this is not the only important force in the dynamics of income 
and wealth distribution, and there are many other forces that play an important role in the long-run dynamics of income and wealth distribution. Also there is a lot of data that still needs to be collected. We know a little bit more today than we used to know, 
but we still know too little,
