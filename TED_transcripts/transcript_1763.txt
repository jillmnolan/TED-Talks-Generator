This is my niece, Stella. She's just turned one and started to walk. And she's walking in that really cool way that
one-year-olds do, a kind of teetering, my-body's-moving-

teenage girl receiving this feedback at one of the most emotionally vulnerable
times in her life. Thousands of people are posting videos like this, mostly teenage girls, reaching out in this way. But what's leading them to do this? Well, today's teenagers are rarely alone. They're under pressure to be online
