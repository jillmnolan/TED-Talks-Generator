I just met you on a bus, and we would really like 
to get to know each other, but I've got to get off at the next stop, so you're going to tell me 
three things about yourself that just define you as a person, three things about yourself that will help me understand who you are, three things that just 
get to your very essence. And what I'm wondering is, of those three things, is any one of them surviving some kind of trauma? Cancer survivor, rape survivor, Holocaust survivor, incest survivor. Ever notice how we tend to identify ourselves by our wounds? And where I have seen this survivor identity have the most consequences is in the cancer community. And I've been around this 
community for a long time, because I've been a hospice 
and a hospital chaplain for almost 30 years. And in 2005, I was working at a big cancer center when I received the news that my mother had breast cancer. And then five days later, I received the news that I had breast cancer.
