The Earth needs no introduction. It needs no introduction in part 
because the Apollo 17 astronauts, when they were hurtling 
around the moon in 1972, took this iconic image. It galvanized a whole 
generation of human beings to realize that we're on 
Spaceship Earth, fragile and finite as it is,
 and that we need 
to take care of it. But while this picture
is beautiful, it's static, and the Earth is constantly changing. It's changing on days' time
scales with human activity. And the satellite imagery we 
have of it today is old. Typically, years old. And that's important because
you can't fix what you can't see. What we'd ideally want is images
of the whole planet every day. So, what's standing in our way? What's the problem? This is the problem: Satellites are big, expensive 
and they're slow. This one weighs three tons. It's six meters tall, four meters wide. It took up the entire fairing
of a rocket just to launch it. One satellite, one rocket. It cost 855 million dollars. Satellites like these have 
done an amazing job at helping us to understand our planet. But if we want to understand 
it much more regularly, we need lots of satellites, and this model isn't scalable. So me and my friends, 
we started Planet Labs to make satellites ultra-compact
 and small and highly capable. I'm going to show you what 
our satellite looks like: This is our satellite. This is not a scale model,
 this is the real size. It's 10 by 10 by 30 centimeters, it weighs four kilograms, and we've stuffed the latest 
and greatest electronics and sensor systems into 
this little package so that even though this is really small, this can take pictures 10 times the
resolution of the big satellite here, even though it weighs one 
thousandth of the mass.
