Well, good afternoon. How many of you took the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge? (Applause) Woo hoo! Well, I have to tell you, from 
the bottom of our hearts, thank you so very, very much. Do you know to date the ALS Association has raised 125 million dollars? Woo hoo! (Applause) It takes me back to the summer of 2011. My family, my kids had all grown up. We were officially empty nesters, and we decided, let's 
go on a family vacation. Jenn, my daughter, and my son-in-law came down from New York. My youngest, Andrew, he came down from his home in Charlestown where he was working in Boston, and my son Pete, who had played at 
Boston College, baseball, had played baseball 
professionally in Europe, and had now come home and was selling
group insurance, he also joined us. And one night, I found myself having a beer with Pete, and Pete was looking at 
me and he just said, "You know, Mom, I don't know, selling group insurance 
is just not my passion." He said, "I just don't feel 
I'm living up to my potential. I don't feel this is my mission in life." And he said, "You know, 
oh by the way, Mom, I have to leave early from vacation because my inter-city league team 
that I play for made the playoffs, and I have to get back to Boston 
because I can't let my team down. I'm just not as passionate about my job as I am about baseball."
