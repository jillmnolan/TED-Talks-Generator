Now, I'm an ethnobotanist. That's a scientist who 
works in the rainforest to document how people use local plants. I've been doing this for a long time, and I want to tell you, these people know these forests
and these medicinal treasures better than we do and
better than we ever will. But also, these cultures, these indigenous cultures, are disappearing much faster
than the forests themselves. And the greatest and
most endangered species in the Amazon Rainforest is not the jaguar, it's not the harpy eagle, it's the isolated and uncontacted tribes. Now four years ago, I injured my 
foot in a climbing accident and I went to the doctor. She gave me heat, she gave me cold, aspirin, narcotic painkillers, anti-inflammatories, cortisone shots. It didn't work. Several months later, I was in the northeast Amazon, walked into a village, and the shaman said, "You're limping." And I'll never forget
this as long as I live. He looked me in the face and he said, "Take off your shoe and give 
me your machete." (Laughter) He walked over to a palm tree and carved off a fern, threw it in the fire, applied it to my foot, threw it in a pot of water, and had me drink the tea. The pain disappeared for seven months. When it came back, I went
to see the shaman again. He gave me the same treatment, and I've been cured for three years now. Who would you rather be treated by? (Applause)
