So, I thought a lot about
the first word I'd say today, and I decided to say "Colombia." And the reason, I don't know
how many of you have visited Colombia, but Colombia is just north
of the border with Brazil. It's a beautiful country with extraordinary people,
like me and others -- (Laughter) -- and it's populated
with incredible fauna, flora. It's got water; it's got everything
to be the perfect place. But we have a few problems. You may have heard of some of them. We have the oldest
standing guerrilla in the world. It's been around for over 50 years, which means that in my lifetime, I have never lived one day 
of peace in my country. This guerrilla -- and the main group
is the FARC guerrillas, Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia -- they have financed their war
by kidnapping, by extortion, by getting into the drug trade,
by illegal mining. There has been terrorism.
There have been random bombs. So it's not good.
It's not really good. And if you look at the human cost
of this war over 50 years, we have had more than
5.7 million displaced population. It's one of the biggest displaced
populations in the world, and this conflict has cost
over 220,000 lives.
