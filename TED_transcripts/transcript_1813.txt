Has anyone among you
ever been exposed to tear gas? Tear gas? Anyone? I'm sorry to hear that, so you might know
that it's a very toxic substance, but you might not know
that it's a very simple molecule with an unpronouncable name: it's called chlorobenzalmalononitrile. 
I made it. It's decades old, but it's becoming
very trendy among police forces around the planet lately, it seems, and according to my experience
as a non-voluntary breather of it, tear gas has two main
but quite opposite effects. One, it can really burn your eyes, and two, it can also
help you to open them. Tear gas definitely helped
to open mine to something that I want to share
with you this afternoon: that livestreaming the power
of independent broadcasts through the web can be a game-changer in journalism, in activism, and as I see it,
in the political discourse as well. That idea started 
to dawn on me in early 2011
