I'd like to start my performance by saying
90 percent of everything is crap. (Laughter) It's called Sturgeon's law,
and what that means is that the majority of anything
is always bad. I have a giraffe here. I'm going to throw the giraffe
behind my back and whoever catches it is going
to help me on this next thing. Sir, you caught the giraffe. I have a playing card in my hand. Freely name any card in the deck. Audience member: 10 of hearts.
