My name is Harry Baker.
Harry Baker is my name. If your name was Harry Baker,
then our names would be the same. (Laughter) It's a short introductory part. Yeah, I'm Harry. I study maths. I write poetry. So I thought I'd start
with a love poem about prime numbers. (Laughter) This is called "59." I was going to call it
"Prime Time Loving." That reaction is why I didn't. (Laughter) So, "59." 59 wakes up on the wrong 
side of the bed. Realizes all his hair is 
on one side of his head.
