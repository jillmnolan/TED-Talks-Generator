"Where are you from?"
said the pale, tattooed man. "Where are you from?" It's September 21, 2001, 10 days after the worst attack
on America since World War II. Everyone wonders about the next plane. People are looking for scapegoats. The president, 
the night before, pledges to "bring our enemies to justice 
or bring justice to our enemies." And in the Dallas mini-mart, a Dallas mini-part surrounded
by tire shops and strip joints a Bangladeshi immigrant 
works the register. Back home, Raisuddin Bhuiyan
was a big man, an Air Force officer. But he dreamed of a 
fresh start in America. If he had to work briefly in a mini-mart
to save up for I.T. classes and his wedding in two months, so be it. Then, on September 21, 
that tattooed man enters the mart. He holds a shotgun. Raisuddin knows the drill: puts cash on the counter. This time, the man doesn't 
touch the money. "Where are you from?" he asks. "Excuse me?" Raisuddin answers. His accent betrays him. The tattooed man, a self-styled
true American vigilante, shoots Raisuddin in revenge for 9/11. Raisuddin feels millions of bees
stinging his face. In fact, dozens of scalding, 
birdshot pellets puncture his head. Behind the counter, he lays in blood. He cups a hand over his forehead
to keep in the brains on which he'd gambled everything. He recites verses from the Koran,
begging his God to live. He senses he is dying. He didn't die. His right eye left him.
