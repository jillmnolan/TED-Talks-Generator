When I was a kid, the disaster we worried about most 
was a nuclear war. That's why we had a barrel like this
down in our basement, filled with cans of food and water. When the nuclear attack came, we were supposed to go downstairs,
hunker down, and eat out of that barrel. Today the greatest risk 
of global catastrophe doesn't look like this. Instead, it looks like this. If anything kills over 10 million people
in the next few decades, it's most likely to be 
a highly infectious virus rather than a war. Not missiles, but microbes. Now, part of the reason for this is that we've invested a huge amount
in nuclear deterrents. But we've actually invested very little 
in a system to stop an epidemic. We're not ready for the next epidemic. Let's look at Ebola. I'm sure all of you read about it 
in the newspaper, lots of tough challenges. I followed it carefully 
through the case analysis tools we use to track polio eradication. And as you look at what went on, the problem wasn't that there was a system
that didn't work well enough, the problem was that we 
didn't have a system at all. In fact, there's some pretty obvious
key missing pieces. We didn't have a group of epidemiologists 
ready to go, who would have gone, seen what the disease was,
seen how far it had spread. The case reports came in on paper. It was very delayed
before they were put online and they were extremely inaccurate. We didn't have a medical team ready to go. We didn't have a way of preparing people.
