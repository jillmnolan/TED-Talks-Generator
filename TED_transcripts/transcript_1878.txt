I dedicated the past two years
to understanding how people achieve their dreams. When we think about the dreams we have, and the dent we want to leave
in the universe, it is striking to see how big
of an overlap there is between the dreams that we have,
and projects that never happen. (Laughter) So I'm here to talk to you today about five ways
how not to follow your dreams. One: Believe in overnight success. You know the story, right? The tech guy built a mobile app
and sold it very fast for a lot of money. You know, the story may seem real,
but I bet it's incomplete. If you go investigate further, the guy has done 30 apps before and he has done a master's
on the topic, a PhD. He has been working
on the topic for 20 years. This is really interesting. I myself have a story in Brazil
that people think is an overnight success. I come from a humble family, and two weeks before
the deadline to apply for MIT, I started the application process.
