So I've had the great privilege of traveling to some incredible places, photographing these distant landscapes
and remote cultures all over the world. I love my job. But people think it's
this string of epiphanies and sunrises and rainbows, when in reality, it looks
more something like this. (Laughter) This is my office. We can't afford the fanciest places
to stay at night, so we tend to sleep a lot outdoors. As long as we can stay dry, that's a bonus. We also can't afford
the fanciest restaurants. So we tend to eat
whatever's on the local menu.
