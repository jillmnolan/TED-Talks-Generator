As a singer-songwriter, people often ask me about my influences
or, as I like to call them, my sonic lineages. And I could easily tell you that I was shaped by the jazz
and hip hop that I grew up with, by the Ethiopian heritage of my ancestors, or by the 1980s pop
on my childhood radio stations. But beyond genre,
there is another question: how do the sounds we hear every day
influence the music that we make? I believe that everyday soundscape can be the most unexpected
inspiration for songwriting, and to look at this idea
a little bit more closely, I'm going to talk today
about three things: nature, language and silence -- or rather, the impossibility
of true silence. And through this I hope to give you
a sense of a world already alive with musical expression, with each of us serving
as active participants, whether we know it or not. I'm going to start today with nature,
but before we do that, let's quickly listen to this snippet
of an opera singer warming up. Here it is. (Singing) (Singing ends) It's beautiful, isn't it? Gotcha! That is actually not the sound
of an opera singer warming up. That is the sound of a bird slowed down to a pace that the human ear mistakenly
recognizes as its own.
