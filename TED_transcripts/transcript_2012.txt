It was April 8, 2003. I was in Baghdad,
covering the war in Iraq. That day, Americans tanks
started arriving in Baghdad. We were just a few journalists
in the Palestine Hotel, and, as happens in war, the fighting began to approach
outside our windows. Baghdad was covered
in black smoke and oil. It smelled awful. We couldn't see a thing,
but we knew what was happening. Of course, I was supposed
to be writing an article, but that's how it always goes -- you're supposed to be writing
and something big happens. So I was in my room on the 16th floor, writing and looking out the window
every now and then to see what was happening. Suddenly, there was a huge explosion. During the previous three weeks, there had been shelling
with half-ton missiles, but this time, the shock -- I felt it inside of me, and I thought, "It's very close. It's very, very close." So I went down to see what was happening. I went down to the 15th floor to take a look. And I saw people, journalists,
screaming in the hallways. I walked into a room and realized that it had
been hit by a missile. Someone had been wounded. There was a man near the window, a cameraman named Taras Protsyuk, lying face-down. Having worked in a hospital before,
I wanted to help out. So I turned him over. And when I turned him over, I noticed that he was open
from sternum to pubis, but I couldn't see anything,
nothing at all. All I saw was a white, pearly,
shiny spot that blinded me, and I didn't understand what was going on. Once the spot disappeared
and I could see his wound, which was very serious, my buddies and I put a sheet
underneath him, and we carried him onto an elevator
that stopped at each of the 15 floors. We put him in a car
that took him to the hospital. He died on the way to the hospital.
