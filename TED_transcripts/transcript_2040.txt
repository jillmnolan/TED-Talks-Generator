Our grandparents' generation
created an amazing system of canals and reservoirs
that made it possible for people to live in places
where there wasn't a lot of water. For example, during the Great Depression, they created the Hoover Dam, which in turn, created Lake Mead and made it possible for the cities
of Las Vegas and Phoenix and Los Angeles to provide water for people who lived
in a really dry place. In the 20th century,
we literally spent trillions of dollars building infrastructure
to get water to our cities. In terms of economic development,
it was a great investment. But in the last decade,
we've seen the combined effects of climate change, population growth
and competition for water resources threaten these vital lifelines
and water resources. This figure shows you the change
in the lake level of Lake Mead that happened in the last 15 years. You can see starting around the year 2000, the lake level started to drop. And it was dropping at such a rate that it would have left the drinking water
intakes for Las Vegas high and dry. The city became so concerned about this that they recently constructed
a new drinking water intake structure that they referred to as the "Third Straw" to pull water out
of the greater depths of the lake. The challenges associated
with providing water to a modern city are not restricted
to the American Southwest. In the year 2007, the third largest
city in Australia, Brisbane, came within 6 months
of running out of water.
