As a boy in Lima, my grandfather told me a legend of the Spanish conquest of Peru. Atahualpa, emperor of the Inca,
had been captured and killed. Pizarro and his conquistadors
had grown rich, and tales of their conquest
and glory had reached Spain and was bringing new waves of Spaniards,
hungry for gold and glory. They would go into towns and ask the Inca, "Where's another civilization
we can conquer? Where's more gold?" And the Inca, out of vengeance, told them, "Go to the Amazon. You'll find all the gold you want there. In fact, there is a city called Paititi --
El Dorado in Spanish -- made entirely of gold." The Spanish set off into the jungle, but the few that return
come back with stories, stories of powerful shamans, of warriors with poisoned arrows, of trees so tall they blotted out the sun, spiders that ate birds,
snakes that swallowed men whole and a river that boiled. All this became a childhood memory. And years passed. I'm working on my PhD at SMU, trying to understand
Peru's geothermal energy potential, when I remember this legend, and I began asking that question. Could the boiling river exist? I asked colleagues from universities, the government, oil, gas and mining companies, and the answer was a unanimous no. And this makes sense. You see, boiling rivers
do exist in the world, but they're generally
associated with volcanoes. You need a powerful heat source to produce such a large
geothermal manifestation. And as you can see from the red dots
here, which are volcanoes, we don't have volcanoes in the Amazon, nor in most of Peru. So it follows: We should not expect
to see a boiling river. Telling this same story
