So I'm a neurosurgeon. And like most of my colleagues, I have to deal, every day,
with human tragedies. I realize how your life can change
from one second to the other after a major stroke
or after a car accident. And what is very frustrating
for us neurosurgeons is to realize that unlike
other organs of the body, the brain has very little
ability for self-repair. And after a major injury
of your central nervous system, the patients often remain
with a severe handicap. And that's probably
the reason why I've chosen to be a functional neurosurgeon. What is a functional neurosurgeon? It's a doctor who is trying to improve
a neurological function through different surgical strategies. You've certainly heard of
one of the famous ones called deep brain stimulation, where you implant an electrode
in the depths of the brain in order to modulate a circuit of neurons to improve a neurological function. It's really an amazing technology in that it has improved
the destiny of patients with Parkinson's disease, with severe tremor, with severe pain. However, neuromodulation
does not mean neuro-repair. And the dream of functional neurosurgeons is to repair the brain. I think that we are approaching this dream. And I would like to show you that we are very close to this. And that with a little bit of help, the brain is able to help itself. So the story started 15 years ago. At that time, I was a chief resident working days and nights
in the emergency room. I often had to take care
of patients with head trauma. You have to imagine that when a patient
comes in with a severe head trauma, his brain is swelling and he's increasing
his intracranial pressure. And in order to save his life, you have to decrease
this intracranial pressure. And to do that, you sometimes have to remove
a piece of swollen brain. So instead of throwing away
these pieces of swollen brain,
