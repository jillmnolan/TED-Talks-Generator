I have spent the past 38 years
trying to be invisible. I'm a copy editor. I work at The New Yorker, and copyediting for The New Yorker
is like playing shortstop for a Major League Baseball team: every little movement
gets picked over by the critics -- God forbid you should commit an error. Just to clarify: copy editors don't choose
what goes into the magazine. We work at the level of the sentence, maybe the paragraph, the words, the punctuation. Our business is in the details.
