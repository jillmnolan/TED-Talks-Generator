What is it that French people
do better than all the others? If you would take polls, the top three answers might be: love, wine and whining. (Laughter) Maybe. But let me suggest a fourth one: mathematics. Did you know that Paris
has more mathematicians than any other city in the world? And more streets
with mathematicians' names, too. And if you look at the statistics
of the Fields Medal, often called the Nobel Prize
for mathematics, and always awarded to mathematicians
below the age of 40, you will find that France has more
Fields medalists per inhabitant than any other country. What is it that we find so sexy in math? After all, it seems to be
dull and abstract, just numbers and computations
and rules to apply. Mathematics may be abstract, but it's not dull and it's not about computing. It is about reasoning and proving our core activity. It is about imagination, the talent which we most praise. It is about finding the truth. There's nothing like the feeling
which invades you when after months of hard thinking, you finally understand the right
reasoning to solve your problem.
