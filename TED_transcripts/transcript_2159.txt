As a little Hawaiian, my mom and auntie always told me
stories about Kalaupapa -- the Hawaiian leper colony surrounded by the highest
sea cliffs in the world -- and Father Damien, the Belgian missionary who gave his life
for the Hawaiian community. As a young nurse, my aunt trained the nuns
caring for the remaining lepers almost a 100 years after
Father Damien died of leprosy. I remember stories she told about traveling down
switchback cliff paths on a mule, while my uncle played
her favorite hula songs on the ukulele all the way down to Kalaupapa. You see, as a youngster, I was always curious about a few things. First was why a Belgian missionary
chose to live in complete isolation in Kalaupapa, knowing he would inevitably
contract leprosy from the community of people
he sought to help. And secondly, where did the leprosy bacteria come from?
