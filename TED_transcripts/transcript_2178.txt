So when I decided to create
an art piece in Manshiyat Naser, the neighborhood of the Cairo
garbage collectors in Egypt, I never thought this project would be the most amazing human experience
that I would ever live. As an artist, I had
this humanist intention of beautifying a poor
and neglected neighborhood by bringing art to it and hopefully
shining light on this isolated community. The first time I heard about
this Christian Coptic community was in 2009 when the Egyptian authorities
under the regime of Hosni Mubarak decided to slaughter 300,000 pigs
using the pretext of H1N1 virus. Originally, they are pig breeders. Their pigs and other animals
are fed with the organic waste that they collect on a daily basis. This event killed their livelihood. The first time I entered Manshiyat Naser,
it felt like a maze. I was looking for the St. Simon Monastery
on the top of the Muqattam Mountain. So you go right, then straight,
then right again, then left to reach all the way to the top. But to reach there, you must dodge between
the trucks overpacked with garbage and slalom between the tuk-tuks, the fastest vehicle to move around
in the neighborhood. The smell of the garbage
unloaded from those trucks was intense, and the noise of the traffic
was loud and overbearing. Add to it the din created by the crushers
in those warehouses along the way. From outside it looks chaotic,
but everything is perfectly organized.
