I'd like you to imagine the world anew. I'd like to show you some maps, which have been drawn by Ben Hennig, of the planet in a way that most of you will never
have seen the planet depicted before. Here's an image
that you're very familiar with. I'm old enough that I was actually born
before we saw this image. Apparently some of my first words
were "moona, moona," but I think that's my mom
having a particular fantasy about what her baby boy could see on the flickering
black and white TV screen. It's only been a few centuries since we've actually, most of us,
thought of our planet as spherical. When we first saw
these images in the 1960s, the world was changing
at an incredible rate. In my own little discipline
of human geography, a cartographer called Waldo Tobler was drawing new maps of the planet, and these maps have now spread, and I'm going to show you one of them now. This map is a map of the world, but it's a map which looks to you a little bit strange. It's a map in which we stretched places, so that those areas which contain
many people are drawn larger, and those areas,
like the Sahara and the Himalayas, in which there are few people,
have been shrunk away. Everybody on the planet
is given an equal amount of space. The cities are shown shining bright. The lines are showing you
submarine cables and trade routes. And there's one particular line
that goes from the Chinese port of Dalian through past Singapore, through the Suez Canal, through the Mediterranean
and round to Rotterdam. And it's showing you the route of what was the world's
largest ship just a year ago, a ship which was taking
so many containers of goods that when they were unloaded, if the lorries had all gone in convoy,
they would have been 100 kilometers long. This is how our world is now connected. This is the quantity of stuff
we are now moving around the world, just on one ship, on one voyage, in five weeks. We've lived in cities
for a very long time, but most of us didn't live in cities.
