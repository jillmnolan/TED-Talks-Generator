when I was 18 years old, I had the golden opportunity to go
on an international exchange program. Ironically I'm an Australian
who prefers proper icy cold weather, so I was both excited and tearful
when I got on a plane to Iceland, after just having farewelled
my parents and brothers goodbye. I was welcomed into the home
of a beautiful Icelandic family who took me hiking, and helped me get a grasp
of the melodic Icelandic language. I struggled a bit with the initial
period of homesickness. I snowboarded after school, and I slept a lot. Two hours of chemistry class in a language
that you don't yet fully understand can be a pretty good sedative. (Laughter) My teacher recommended
I try out for the school play, just to get me a bit more socially active. It turns out I didn't end up
being part of the play, but through it I met Thordis. We shared a lovely teenage romance, and we'd meet at lunchtimes
to just hold hands
