Today I want to talk
about the meaning of words, how we define them and how they, almost as revenge, define us. The English language
is a magnificent sponge. I love the English language.
I'm glad that I speak it. But for all that, it has a lot of holes. In Greek, there's a word, "lachesism" which is the hunger for disaster. You know, when you see
a thunderstorm on the horizon and you just find yourself
rooting for the storm.
