Well, as many of you know, the results of the recent
election were as follows: Hillary Clinton, the Democratic candidate won a landslide victory with 52 percent of the overall vote. Jill Stein, the Green candidate, came a distant second, with 19 percent. Donald J. Trump, the Republic candidate, was hot on her heels with 14 percent, and the remainder of the vote
were shared between abstainers and Gary Johnson,
the Libertarian candidate. (Laughter) Now, what parallel universe
do you suppose I live in? Well, I don't live in a parallel universe. I live in the world,
and that is how the world voted. So let me take you back
and explain what I mean by that. In June this year, I launched something
called the Global Vote. And the Global Vote
does exactly what it says on the tin. For the first time in history, it lets anybody, anywhere in the world, vote in the elections
of other people's countries. Now, why would you do that? What's the point? Well, let me show you what it looks like. You go to a website, rather a beautiful website, and then you select an election. Here's a bunch that we've already covered. We do about one a month, or thereabouts. So you can see Bulgaria,
the United States of America, Secretary-General of the United Nations, the Brexit referendum at the end there. You select the election
that you're interested in, and you pick the candidates. These are the candidates
from the recent presidential election
