So in 2011, I altered my name so that I could participate
in Far Right youth camp in Hungary. I was doing a PhD looking at
youth political socialization -- why young people were developing
political ideologies in a post-communist setting, and I saw that a lot
of young people I was talking to were joining the Far Right, and this was astounding to me. So I wanted to enroll in this youth camp to get a better understanding
of why people were joining. So a colleague enrolled me, and my last name sounds
a little bit too Jewish.
