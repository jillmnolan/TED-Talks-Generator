This is my favorite place on earth, Salar de Uyuni in Bolivia. And when it's covered
in a thin layer of water, it reflects the clouds. There are days when you feel
as if you're floating among the clouds. But there are days
when the horizon disappears; there's no longer a top or a bottom. You feel immersed in something bigger. It was there that one night
I woke up from a dream, and I saw that the stars
were also reflected on the water. And that wasn't a dream. It was as if you could walk
among the stars. With every step I took,
the stars reverberated under my feet. It was like I was floating in the universe
among clouds of galaxies. But what's floating there today
are not just clouds of galaxies but also clouds of plastic. These are the footprints
we're leaving on the planet. They're signs of an era in which the behavior of some humans
is making a global impact on our ecosystems. This era is called the Anthropocene. There's also another type
of toxic clouds that float in the air, like the ones that form
from carbon dioxide emissions and from the burning of fossil fuels --
oil, carbon, gas -- clouds that, when we see them, pollute our dreams. I don't know about all of you, but I've always dreamed of floating
among the clouds. Maybe today we can imagine together
other types of clouds, clouds we can live with. If you're wondering
about that photo, I'll explain: it looks like a collage
or photomontage -- something weird. No; it's reality. But sometimes I ask myself:
What is reality? According to Alexander Kluge: "Human beings are not
interested in reality.
