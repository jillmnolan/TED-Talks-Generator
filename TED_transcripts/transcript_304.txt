Whoa, dude. (Laughter) Check out those killer equations. Sweet. Actually, for the next 18 minutes
I'm going to do the best I can to describe the beauty
of particle physics without equations. It turns out there's a lot
we can learn from coral. A coral is a very beautiful
and unusual animal. Each coral head consists
of thousands of individual polyps. These polyps are continually
budding and branching into genetically identical neighbors. If we imagine this
to be a hyperintelligent coral, we can single out an individual
and ask him a reasonable question. We can ask how exactly
he got to be in this particular location compared to his neighbors -- if it was just chance,
or destiny, or what? Now, after admonishing us
for turning the temperature up too high, he would tell us that our question
was completely stupid. These corals can be kind of mean, you see, and I have surfing scars to prove that. But this polyp would continue and tell us that his neighbors were
quite clearly identical copies of him. That he was in all
these other locations as well, but experiencing them
as separate individuals. For a coral, branching
into different copies is the most natural thing in the world. Unlike us, a hyperintelligent coral would be uniquely prepared
to understand quantum mechanics. The mathematics of quantum mechanics very accurately describes
how our universe works. And it tells us our reality is continually
branching into different possibilities, just like a coral. It's a weird thing for us humans
to wrap our minds around, since we only ever get
to experience one possibility. This quantum weirdness was first described
