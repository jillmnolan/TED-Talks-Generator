I'd like to talk to you today
about the scale of the scientific effort that goes into making the headlines
you see in the paper. Headlines that look like this
when they have to do with climate change; and like this when they have to do
with air quality or smog. They're two branches of the same field
of atmospheric science. Recently, the headlines looked like this when the Intergovernmental Panel
on Climate Change, or IPCC, put out their report on the state of understanding
of the atmospheric system. That report was written
by 620 scientists from 40 countries. They wrote almost
1,000 pages on the topic, and all of those pages were reviewed by another 400-plus
scientists and reviewers from 113 countries. It's a big community; such a big community, in fact, that our annual gathering is the largest
scientific meeting in the world. Over 15,000 scientists go
to San Francisco every year for that. Every one of those scientists
is in a research group, and every research group studies
a wide variety of topics.
