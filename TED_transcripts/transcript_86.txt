Thank you very much. Now, I've got a story for you. When I arrived off the plane, after a very long journey from the West of England, my computer, my beloved laptop, had gone mad, and had -- oh! -- a bit like that! -- and the display on it -- anyway, the whole thing had burst. And I went to the IT guys here and a gentleman mended my computer, and then he said, "What are you doing here?" and I said "I'm playing the cello and I'm doing a bit of singing," and he said, "Oh, I sort of play the cello as well." And I said, "Do you really?" Anyway, so you're in for a treat, because he's fantastic, and his name's Mark. (Applause) I am also joined by my partner in crime, Thomas Dolby. (Applause) This song is called "Farther than the Sun." (Music)
