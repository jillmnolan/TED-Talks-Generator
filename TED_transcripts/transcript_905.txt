A few weeks ago, I had a chance
to go to Saudi Arabia. And the first thing
I wanted to do as a Muslim was to go to Mecca and visit the Kaaba, the holiest shrine of Islam. And I did that;
I put on my ritualistic dress, I went to the holy mosque, I did my prayers, I observed all the rituals. And meanwhile,
besides all the spirituality, there was one mundane detail in the Kaaba that was pretty interesting for me: there was no separation of sexes. In other words, men and women
were worshiping all together.
