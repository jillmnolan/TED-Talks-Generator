A couple of years ago, when I was attending
the TED conference in Long Beach, I met Harriet. We'd actually met online before --
not the way you're thinking. We were introduced
because we both knew Linda Avey, one of the founders of the first
online personal genomic companies. And because we shared
our genetic information with Linda, she could see that Harriet and I shared a very rare type of mitochondrial DNA,
haplotype K1a1b1a, which meant we were distantly related.
