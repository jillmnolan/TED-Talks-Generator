This is about a place in London called Kiteflyer's Hill where I used to go and spend hours going "When is he coming back? When is he coming back?" So this is another one dedicated to that guy ... who I've got over. But this is "Kiteflyer's Hill." It's a beautiful song written by a guy called Martin Evan, actually, for me. Boo Hewerdine, Thomas Dolby, thank you very much for inviting me. It's been a blessing singing for you. Thank you very much.
